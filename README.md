# JakDojade
Project for algorithms and data structures course

Finding shortest path between two points on a rectangular map divided into squares. Each field on the map can be empty (impassable), be part of a road (passable in both directions), or be a city (passable like a road). The name of each city is given on the map, and each letter occupies one field (the field with the letter is impassable). Moving through one field takes one minute. We can only move between fields adjacent by sides. Additionally, selected cities are connected by one-way air connections. The name of a city will be adjacent (by side or corner) to the city with the first or last letter of the name.
